    <p class="headline">The Habit of Personal Responsibility</p>
    <div class="text1">
      <p>
        Habit 1: Be Proactive is about taking responsibility for your life.
        Proactive people recognize that they are “response-able.” They don’t
        blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior.
        They know they can choose their behavior. Reactive people, on the other
        hand, are often affected by their physical environment. They find
        external sources to blame for their behavior. If the weather is good,
        they feel good. If it isn’t, it affects their attitude and performance,
        and they blame the weather.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these external forces act as stimuli that we respond to. Between the
        stimulus and the response is our greatest power—we have the freedom to
        choose our response. One of the most important things we choose is what
        we say. Our language is a good indicator of how we see ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        A proactive person uses proactive language—I can, I will, I prefer, etc.
        A reactive person uses reactive language—I can’t, I have to, if only.
        Reactive people believe they are not responsible for what they say and
        do—they have no choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proactive people focus their efforts on their Circle of Influence®. They
        work on the things they can do something about: health, children, or
        problems at work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern™—things
        over which they have little or no control: the national debt, terrorism,
        or the weather. Gaining an awareness of the areas in which we expend our
        energies is a giant step in becoming proactive.

      <p class="text2">
        Instead of reacting to or worrying about conditions over which they have
        little or no control, proactive people focus their time and energy on
        things they can control. The problems, challenges, and opportunities we
        face fall into two areas—Circle of Concern and Circle of Influence.
